You can simplify virtual machine (VM) creation by using instance types. Instance types offer a predefined collection of operating system images, workload configurations, and hardware options.

You easily create a VM from an instance type by using the {product-title} web console. From the console you can select a volume with a predefined namespace, operating system, storage class, and size. You then choose an instance type, accept some default settings, and create the VM.

In addition to creating a VM from an instance type with predefined settings, you can:
