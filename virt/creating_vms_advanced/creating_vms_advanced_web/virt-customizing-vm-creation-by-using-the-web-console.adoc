You can create a virtual machine (VM) from an instance type by using the {product-title} web console. When you create a VM from an instance type, you can do so by using pre-defined settings and values or by customizing the VM before or after you create it.

For example, you can create a VM from a list of available bootable volumes and can add Linux- or Windows-based volumes to the list.

You can also customize a VM template and use it to create additional VMs.
